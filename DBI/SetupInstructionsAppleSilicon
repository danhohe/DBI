# Setup Instructions

1. Download the image from DockerHub --> gvenzl/oracle-free
2. Run following command from the terminal and change "your password" to your desired password (this container is setting up a persistent database!):
`docker run -d -p 1521:1521 -e ORACLE_PASSWORD=your password -v oracle-volume:/opt/oracle/oradata gvenzl/oracle-free`
3. Wait until the database is ready to use.
4. Connect via the SQL Developer to the database using "system" as username and your password as in step 2.
5. Check the connection with the "test" button.
6. If everything worked --> Congratulations you just have a created a database. If not please check the troubleshooting section or delete the created container and begin with step 2.

# Troubleshooting
Double check if you downloaded the right image from DockerHub. Make sure to use gvenzl/oracle-free .
### DO NOT DOWNLOAD gvenzl/oracle-xe

check if you passed the right ports in the command(shouldn't be a problem if you copy paste the command from step 2).

make sure you have set a password in the command. If no password is set oracle uses a default password (please google it), if your password isn't replaced then the password is "your password"

for every other problem that might occur please open a issue, i've only listed problems in which i ran into.
